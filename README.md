An online store for electronic goods, created using cutting-edge technologies along with the implementation of Redux and many other libraries to enhance the application's functionality and its responsiveness to user actions. [NORM](https://nice-gadgets-be-etof.onrender.com).

## Description

An online store with a home page designed to provide users with an overall impression of the application. It features three main catalog pages for Phones, Tablets, and Accessories (smartwatches). Users have the ability to add items to their favorites or shopping cart from the product page or directly from the product card. The storage location for items depends on whether you are authenticated on the site or not. In the first scenario, data is stored in local storage, while in the other, it goes into the user object on the server. Additionally, users can log in, perform a general search within the application, and receive notifications about successful and unsuccessful operations.
